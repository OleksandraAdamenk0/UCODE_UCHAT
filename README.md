### General rules

1. Each team member is assigned a branch named after their LMS login.

2. Team members may create new branches if needed.

3. Each new feature should be developed independently; 
in other words, you **cannot** develop more than one feature in the same branch 
(counting from the current state of the main branch).

4. Be aware that any changes pushed to a branch after opening a pull request
will affect that pull request.

5. Before starting a new feature, pull the latest code from the main branch.

6. Do **not** push to another team member's branch.

7. Do **not** create pull requests from another team member's branch.

8. Only pull from the main branch to your own branch; 
avoid merging other members' branches into your branch 
or merges between your own branches.
